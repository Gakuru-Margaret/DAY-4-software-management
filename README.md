Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
   Agile  1. it has fast delivery
           2.it is flexible
           3. it has continous feedback
   Dissadivantage includes 1. it requires many people to collaborate with 
                          2. it is unpredictable. 
                          
 waterfall 1. it has a clear structure.
          2. it is well defined according to stages.
          3. it is easier to manage for fixed requirements.
    Disadivantages includes:1. it has late testing
                            2.it is difficult to adapt to changes
                            3. it is not a flexible method
In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
 -Waterfall is suitabe for projects with well-defined requirements and low uncertainity 
   such as: 1.construcive projects
            2. e.g building a bridge
  -Agile it is suitable for projects with evolving requirementts such as: developing a new mobile app. and softwares development. 
            
What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

     METHODS OF ENSURING QUALITY ASSURANCE
     1. involving end-users in testing to ensure the product meets their needs.
     2. regulary reviewing code for errors
     3. using tols to runtests utomatically
     4.making continuous code changes to detect issues early.
   it is important to maintain high standard because  it enhances user satisfaction, 
   reducing maintainance cost and delivering a reliable products to customers.
   
How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

 -A work breakdown is a herarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, managable 
   parts
